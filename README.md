# Spotify Analyzer

I have always wondered what my music listening habits are 🎵.
That's why I created this dashboard to get to know, understand and visualize 📈 the relationship with my favorite music.
From a personal overview, to listening patterns, and top tracks/artists.

Here, I present you my personal Spotify dashboard 🎉. An interactive web application built using Spotify's API data obtained via Python, transformed using Pandas and visualized with Plotly Dash.
The application is live on [Render](https://spotify-analyzer-b1vf.onrender.com/) and the code is available on my [Github](https://github.com/frankfnl/spotify_analyzer)
